Note: The Window Manager plugin does not currently work perfectly alongside the Tabs plugin. This will be fixed in a future update.

## How to Use

- In multiple panes mode you can press alt+number to focus a particular pane.
  - Note that the numbers in the pane header only show when you press the alt/opt key.
- You can also press alt/opt+shift+m to "zoom" in to a particular pane.
- In pane zoom mode you can use alt+number to focus a particular pane, alt/opt+pageup/pagedown to focus the next/previous pane or click on the tabs.
- To restore your layout to the multiple panes view, press alt/opt+shift+m again.
- Keyboard shortcuts can be customised.
